Session Management Details
Session Creation

To initiate a new session, use the /api/session/create endpoint with a unique session ID. This will generate a QR code, which needs to be scanned via WhatsApp Web to authenticate the session.
Restoring a Session

If a session was previously created and saved, it can be restored using the session ID. This ensures that the session is reinitialized without the need for rescanning the QR code, unless it was disconnected.
Session Status

Each session can have one of the following statuses:

    INITIALIZING: The session is in the process of being created.
    WAITING_FOR_SCAN: Waiting for QR code scanning.
    READY: The session is authenticated and ready for use.
    AUTH_FAILED: Authentication failed.
    DISCONNECTED: The session is disconnected but can be reinitialized.

Message Sending Details
Sending Messages

Once a session is ready, you can send messages to users and groups using the /api/sendText endpoint. The phone number should be provided in the E.164 format for individual users (e.g., 9647729379356), or in a group format (e.g., 9647729379356@g.us).
Simulating Typing

For a more human-like interaction, the API can simulate typing behavior before sending a message. This is achieved by introducing a delay proportional to the message length.
Requirements

    Node.js: The application is built with Node.js, so ensure it is installed.
    Dependencies: Install necessary packages by running:



```npm install express whatsapp-web.js qrcode-terminal fs path```
